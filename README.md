##  Frequently Asked Questions

### Are routes necessary?
No, destinations work without routes. PathFinder will automatically generate a straight line.

### In what direction do I mark waypoints?
**From start to finish**: From the beginning of the route towards the destination.
```
[Start] → WP1 → WP2 → WP3 → [Destination]
```

### How many waypoints can I use?
30 by default, configurable in `config.yml` (recommended maximum: 100).

### Does it work across multiple worlds?
Yes, but you can only navigate to destinations in the same world you're in.

### How do I stop navigation?
Navigation stops automatically when reaching the destination, changing worlds, or disconnecting.
